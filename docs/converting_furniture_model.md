# Converting a New Furniture Model

The IKEA Furniture Assembly Environment implements a furniture model using MuJoCo XML schema and STL meshes for furniture pieces.
To create a new furniture model for the environment, a STL mesh for each furniture piece is required.  
The general steps to adding new furniture are:
1. Procure 3D model of furniture
1. Generate a mujoco XML with [welds](furniture_details.md##Connectors,-Welding)
