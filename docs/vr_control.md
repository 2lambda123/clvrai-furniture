# HTC Vive Controller
We offer support for integrating the Vive controller with the IK controller of Baxter and Sawyer robots.
See the `run_vr` method in `furniture.py` for more details. The VR tests were conducted on a workstation running Ubuntu 18.04 and SteamVR. See this [guide](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/data/linux-vr-oct2018/linuxvr.html) on how to setup.
